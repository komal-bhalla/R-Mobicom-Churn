     
   1. The top five factors (along with their beta coefficients) affecting churn are as follows:

   unq_7        retdays_1        unq_4        unq_3        unq_2   
   0.82911543   0.70322397   0.32332234   0.23578984   0.23168393 

  The 1st factor explains with a unit increase in level 7 of variable uniqsubs, there is 0.82911543 unit increase in churn.

  The 2nd factor explains with a unit increase in variable retdays, there is 0.70322397 unit increase in churn.

  Same explanation applies to next 3 variables. Variable unq_4, unq_3, unq_2 represents the no. of unique subscribers in the household being 4,3,2 respectively.
  Thus family bundles should be rolled out for families with 7,4,3,2 unique subscribers, 
  giving maximum priority to 7 unique subscriber household and the rest unique subscribers will follow in the order given.
  Special offers should be given to customers who make retention calls, at the earliest as per their grieviances.
  
   2. a) The following variables explain cost and billing 
                   Beta Coefficient
  totmrc_Mean     -0.00647469  
  rev_Range        0.00163482  

  ovrrev_Mean      0.00711364  
  
  totrev           0.00025613  
 Variable totmrc_Mean i.e. base plan charge representing cost to customer.
 Variable rev_Range i.e. 'Range of Revenue(charge amount)' representing billing amount
 Variable ovrrev_Mean =DATOVR_MEAN + VCEOVR_MEAN i.e. 'Mean Overage Revenue' (It is the sum of data and voice overage revenues) representing
 the overage revenue earned from customers after billing the same to them.
 Variable totrev i.e. 'total revenue' representing the total revenue earned from customers. 
 Variable totmrc_Mean has beta coefficient value of -0.00647469 meaning a unit increase in this variable is causing decrease in churn
 by -0.00647469/unit.
 Variable rev_Range has beta coefficient value of 0.00163482 meaning a unit increase in this variable is causing increase in churn
 by 0.00163482/unit.
 Variable ovrrev_Mean has beta coefficient value of 0.00711364 meaning a unit increase in this variable is causing increase in churn
 by0.00711364/unit.
 Variable totrev has beta coefficient value of 0.00025613 meaning a unit increase in this variable is causing increase in churn
 by 0.00025613/unit.
 Having said that if above beta values are noticed, a unit increase in them is having almost 0% impact on churn. So it seems cost and billing
 is not very important factors here influencing churn behaviour at Mobicom.

 The variables and their beta coefficients below explain "network and service quality"

 mou_Range           0.00019035
 change_mou         -0.00074548
 drop_blk_Mean       0.00355630
 drop_vce_Range      0.02124469
 mou_opkv_Range     -0.00106567
 iwylis_vce_Mean    -0.02103584
 avgqty              0.00092422
 retdays_1           0.69441947
 complete_Mean      -0.00181741

 
 Variable mou_Range i.e. with a unit increase in 'Range of no. of minutes of use',
 there is an increase in churn by 0.00019035 units.
 Variable change_mou i.e. with a unit increase in 'Percentage change in monthly minutes of use vs previous three month average,
 there is a decrease in churn by 0.00074548 units.
 Variable drop_blk_Mean i.e. with a unit increase in 'Mean no. of dropped or blocked calls', there is an increase in churn by
 0.00355630 units.
 Variable drop_vce_Range i.e. with a unit increase in 'Range of number of dropped (failed) voice calls', there is an increase
  in churn by 0.02124469 units.
 Variable mou_opkv_Range i.e. with a unit increase in 'Range of unrounded minutes of use of off peak voice calls', there is a decrease
 in churn by 0.00106567 units.
 Variable iwylis_vce_Mean i.e. with a unit increase in 'Mean no. of inbound wireless to wireless voice calls', there is a decrease in churn by
  0.02103584 units.
 Variable avgqty i.e. with a unit increase in 'Average monthly number of calls over the life of the customer', there is an increase in churn 
 by 0.00092422 units.
 Variable retdays_1 representing values captured in the variable retdays i.e. with a unit increase in 'No. of days since the last retention call',
 there is an increase in churn by 0.69441947 units.
 This variable is probably explaining the service quality of the company.
 Variable complete_Mean i.e. with a unit increase in 'Mean no. of completed data and voice calls', there is a decrease in churn by 
  0.00181741 units.
  Of the above variables, variable retdays_1 is expressing a very important factor influencing churn behaviour. This is with the increase in the number of days 
 since a customer makes a retention call, the customer's chances of churning is very high. This could probably be because their grieviances are not being catered to properly.
 These customers should be paid more attention to and special offers should be made to them depending upon their grieviances.
 
 2.(b)
 comp_dat_Mean - Mean no. of completed data calls
 plcd_dat_Mean - Mean no. of attempted data calls placed
 opk_dat_Mean - Mean no. of off-peak data calls
 blck_dat_Mean -Mean no. of blocked/failed data calls
 datovr_Mean - Mean revenue of data overage
 datovr_Range - Range of revenue of data overage
 drop_dat_Mean - Mean no. of dropped/failed data calls
  The above variables express data usage connectivity.
  quantile(tele$comp_dat_Mean,prob=c(0.10,0.20,0.30,0.40,0.50,0.60,0.70,0.80,0.82,0.84,0.85,0.90,1))
  The data quality report for all the above variables show that only 10% to 15% customers are actually 
  making data calls or using the Internet. This could be a matter of concern since the global market survey report 
  shows "Subscribers who have switched operators in recent months reported 2 key information sources in their
  decision: the Internet and recommendation of family and friends...
  In this case it seems customers are not really using the internet. So it would be good to work towards attaining 
  more customers to use data and also towards proving quality network connectivity and service to provide 
  maximum customer satisfactions and reduce Churn.
  Since there is not enough usable data for the above variables they are not showing any influence on the churn behaviour at Mobicom.
 
 3. Variable ovrrev_Mean has beta coefficient of 0.00796232.
  var ovrrev_Mean = DATOVR_MEAN + VCEOVR_MEAN i.e. 'Mean overage revenue'
  It is the sum of data and voice overage revenues representing the overage revenue earned from customers
  after billing the same to them.
  The beta coefficient is not showing a strong impact of overage billing as an influencer of churn behaviour.
  Though this might be a matter of concern for few individual customers and they could be catered to on case to case basis.
  But overall rate plan migration as a proactive retention strategy might not help much at Mobicom.

 4. library(gains)
 gains(test$churn,predict(mod5,type="response",newdata=test),groups=10)
 The Gains Chart shows that the top 20% of the probabilities contain 28.4% customers that are highly
 likely to churn.
 Selecting customers with high churn rate:
 test$prob<-predict(mod5,type="response",newdata=test)
 quantile(test$prob,prob=c(0.10,0.20,0.30,0.40,0.50,0.60,0.70,0.80,0.90,1))

 Top 20% of probabilities lie between 0.2908599 and 0.6983775
 Applying cutoff value to predict customer who will churn:-
  pred4<-predict(mod5,type="response",newdata=test)
  pred4<-ifelse(pred4>=0.2908599,1,0)
  table(pred4,test$churn)
  Targeted<-test[test$prob>0.2908599 & test$prob<=0.6983775 & test$churn=="1","Customer_ID"] 
  Targeted<-as.data.frame(Targeted) 
  nrow(Targeted)
  write.csv(Targeted,"Target_Customers.csv",row.names=F) 
 
 Thus using the model can be used to predict customers with high probability of churn and
 extract the target list using their "Customer ID".
 

 5. 
 pred5<-predict(mod5,type="response",newdata=test)
 test$prob<-predict(mod5,type="response",newdata=test)
 quantile(test$prob,prob=c(0.10,0.20,0.30,0.40,0.50,0.60,0.70,0.80,0.90,1))
 pred6<-ifelse(pred5<0.20,"Low_Score",ifelse(pred5>=0.20 & pred5<0.30,"Medium_Score","High_Score"))
 table(pred6,test$churn)
 str(test$totrev)
 quantile(test$totrev,prob=c(0.10,0.20,0.30,0.40,0.50,0.60,0.70,0.80,0.90,1))
 Revenue_Levels<-ifelse(test$totrev<670.660,"Low_Revenue",ifelse(test$totrev>=670.660 & test$totrev<1034.281,"Medium_Revenue","High Revenue"))
 table(Revenue_Levels)
 table(pred6,Revenue_Levels)

 Thus this table can be used to select the levels of customers are to be targeted
  and the Target list can be extracted as follows:
 
 test$prob_levels<-ifelse(pred5<0.20,"Low_Score",ifelse(pred5>=0.20 & pred5<0.30,"Medium_Score","High_Score"))
 test$Revenue_Levels<-ifelse(test$totrev<670.660,"Low_Revenue",ifelse(test$totrev>=670.660 & test$totrev<1034.281,"Medium_Revenue","High_Revenue"))

 Targeted1<-test[test$prob_levels=="High_Score" & test$Revenue_Levels=="High_Revenue","Customer_ID"] 
 Targeted1<-as.data.frame(Targeted1) 
 nrow(Targeted1)
 write.csv(Targeted1,"High_Revenue_Target_Customers.csv",row.names=F) 
 Targeted1
